## Starting this app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..


After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:


yarn start

```




At the moment, the app is fully functional, able to edit current client amount owed, along with email, and name. 

This is a barebones rendering, very limited styling, but ability to manage client data. There is no persistent data as of yet.
